Hi there!ðŸ‘‹<br>
I'm Vinicius and want to thank you for checking out this project.<br><br>

## Description

This is a Time Tracking Dashboard, with responsive layout. You should be able to view the optimal layout depending on your device's screen size.

In addition, this page also has buttons that change design depending on user interaction. 

This is a front-end coding challenge from <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/home">Frontend Mentor</a>.<br><br>

- ``CSS3 media queries``

## What I learned

In this project I was able to put into practice the concecept of Flexbox and Media Queries on CSS3.

My next goal is to start studying JavaScript and include the correct functionality for the buttons on each card in the project, changing the time frequency depending on the choice. <br><br>
